# 🎮 Color Link Game

<br />

## 📝 Description

Color Link is an engaging puzzle game where players connect matching colored dots while following specific game rules. The game combines strategic thinking with visual problem-solving, offering a progressively challenging experience across 100 levels.

<br />

## ✨ Features

- **100 Progressive Levels**: Each level offers unique dot configurations
- **Multiple Color Pairs**: 6-8 dots per level with various color combinations
- **Intuitive Controls**: Touch and drag to create connections
- **Smart Path Detection**: Prevents invalid moves and intersections
- **Level Progress Tracking**: Saves your progress as you advance

## 🎯 Game Rules

1. Connect dots of the same color with continuous lines
2. Lines cannot:
   - Cross other lines
   - Pass through other dots
